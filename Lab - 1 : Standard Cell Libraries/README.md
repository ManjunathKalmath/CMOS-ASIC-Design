a] we are introduced with the different Standard Cell libraries and they are as follows:
b] What are Liberty files and LEF files and what they contain
c] Cells with Different Drive Strength
d] Cell Capacitance
e] Power and Performance of Cells with different Drive strengths
f] Different P-V-T(Process - Voltage - Temperature) conditions
g] Physical Design Data such Cell height, No. of metal layers,Routing pitch, Cell height in routing tracks

Differnt Libraries are as follows: 
1] RAK (from Cadenceâ€™s Rapid Adoption Kit) Library
2] NangateOpenCellLibrary
3] Nangate_15nm_OCL Library
4] Skywater Library

And we are introduced with Unix command "grep" to get the desired string

Using grep we are asked to fill the tables given in the assignment
