- What are Liberty files and LEF files and what they contain
- Cells with Different Drive Strength
- Cell Capacitance
- Power and Performance of Cells with different Drive strengths
- Different P-V-T(Process - Voltage - Temperature) conditions
- Physical Design Data such Cell height, No. of metal layers,Routing pitch, Cell height in routing tracks

Differnt Libraries are as follows: 
- RAK (from Cadenceâ€™s Rapid Adoption Kit) Library
- NangateOpenCellLibrary
- Nangate_15nm_OCL Library
- Skywater Library

And we are introduced with Unix command "grep" to get the desired string

Using grep we are asked to fill the tables given in the assignment
